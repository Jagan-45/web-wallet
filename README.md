## Vercel Deployment

The project is deployed using **Vercel** for automatic scaling and security. However, during deployment, you might encounter the following issue:

### **"Buffer is not defined" Error**

This error typically occurs because Webpack 5 no longer automatically polyfills Node.js core modules such as `Buffer`. You can fix this by using injecting buffer to globalthis object.

### Solution: 

To resolve this issue, add the following in the respective file:

```javascript
import {Buffer} from 'buffer';
globalthis.Buffer=Buffer;
```

This will ensure that the `Buffer` module is available globally, solving the "Buffer is not defined" error during deployment on Vercel.

### Steps to Deploy on Vercel

1. **Login to Vercel**: 
   Visit [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and log in or sign up.

2. **Connect GitHub Repository**:
   - Link your project repository from GitHub.
   - Select the correct branch to deploy.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Go to the project settings on Vercel and add any required environment variables (e.g., blockchain API URLs, Web3 provider URLs).

4. **Automatic Deployment**:
   - Every push to the configured branch will trigger automatic deployments.

5. **Check Live Deployment**: 
   - Once deployed, your app will be available at a Vercel-generated URL or your custom domain.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, such as deployment failures or runtime errors, check the Vercel logs for detailed information. You can also try the following:

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
- Verify environment variables are correctly set in both `.env` and Vercel's project settings.
- Check compatibility of polyfills for Node.js modules in browser environments, particularly `crypto`, `stream`, and `buffer`.

### Useful Commands

- **Development**: 
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  Starts the development server with hot reloading at `http://localhost:5173`.

- **Build for Production**:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  Builds the application for production.

- **Preview Build**:
  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```
  Previews the built application locally before deploying it.
